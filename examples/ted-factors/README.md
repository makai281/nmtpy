# Factored Neural Machine Translation system

This system generates multiple outputs for the neural network.

## TED data 

- Download [examples-ted-data.tar.bz2]() and extract it into the `data/` folder.

- Build the vocabulary dictionaries for each train file:

`nmt-build-dict train_file`

- Option factors enable the factored system.
Factors parameter gets as argument `evalf` which will evaluate the model just with the first output or a script to combine the 2 outputs as desired.

This script will need as arguments `lang, first_output_hyp_file, second_output_hyp_file, reference_file` in this order and will print the corresponding BLEU score.

## FNMT Training

Run `nmt-train -c attention_factors-ted-en-fr.conf` to train a FNMT on this corpus. 

## FNMT Translation

When the training is over, you can translate the test set using the following command:

```
nmt-translate-factors -m ~/nmtpy/models/<your model file> \
                      -S ~/nmtpy/examples/ted-factors/data/dev.en \
                      -R ~/nmtpy/examples/ted-factors/data/dev.fr \
                         ~/nmtpy/examples/ted-factors/data/dev.lemma.fr \
                         ~/nmtpy/examples/ted-factors/data/dev.factors.fr \
                      -o trans_dev.lemma.fr trans_dev.factors.fr \
                      -fa evalf
```
The option -R needs the references of the word-level, first output and second output, repectively.

In -fa option you can include your script to combine both outputs if desired instead of evalf option.
