# Examples

In this folder you can find ready-to-train baseline models for several tasks/architectures.

If you use `fusion_*` multimodal architectures in your work, please cite the following

### Getting the Image Features

For multimodal baselines, you will need the convolutional features extracted
from a pre-trained ResNet-50. You can download these files from the links below:

 - [flickr30k_ResNets50_blck4_train.fp16.npy.xz]() (6GB)
 - [flickr30k_ResNets50_blck4_val.fp16.npy.xz]() (214M)
 - [flickr30k_ResNets50_blck4_test.fp16.npy.xz]() (211M)

After downloading the files, extract them using the following command:

```
xz -d <downloaded xz file>
```

Each `.npy` file contains 14x14x1024 convolutional feature maps for each image
which are extracted from **res4f_relu** layer of a ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet:

```
>> valfeats = numpy.load('flickr30k_ResNets50_blck4_val.fp16.npy')
>> valfeats.shape
(1014, 196, 1024)
# 1014: n_samples
#  196: flattened 14x14 into 196 for convenience
# 1024: n_feature_maps
```
